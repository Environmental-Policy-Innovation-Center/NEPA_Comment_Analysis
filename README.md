# NEPA_Comment_Analysis
Code analyzing public comments taken from NEPA's regulation revisions (phase 2) using chatGPT &amp; NLP methods.  

- R_Source: Contains all functions used for the analysis
  
- Data: Holds all small datasets produced during the analysis. Larger files (i.e., the NEPA_Comments_Oct2023.csv which contains all comments in the federal docket) is available on AWS.

- NEPACommentAnalysis.R: Contains all of the analysis code, organized by topic.

Here, we specifically asked chatGPT to summarize the main points from these public comments with an emphaisis on technology. The final response (from multiple iterations of chatGPT) was: "These comments relate to technology insofar as they prioritize the need for a rapid transition to clean energy, which could involve the development of new technologies and infrastructure projects. The inclusion of future climate impacts and consideration of natural sustainable energy in project proposals also relate to the potential role of technology in mitigating climate change impacts. They also emphasize the importance of considering future climate impacts when evaluating new projects, as well as the need for transparency and community involvement in the project development process which can be facilitated through technological tools and platforms. Lastly, the comments highlight the importance of environmental justice and respecting tribal sovereignty throughout the project development process."
