"41","40","1. Strengthening the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is important to prevent polluting projects from impacting the health and environment of communities.
2. The final NEPA regulations must require agencies to consider alternatives that decrease impacts on air, water, and land while also looking at cumulative impacts communities face from exposure to pollutants.
3. NEPA should be reaffirmed as a tool for environmental justice, giving communities meaningful input in the project development process and avoiding disproportionate impacts on frontline communities.
4. NEPA should require agencies to include future climate impacts when considering new projects, resulting in safer, more resilient infrastructure for communities.
5. There should be transparency in the project development process by requiring a timely release of documents and a minimum 30-day comment period for community review. Tribal consultation and respect for tribal sovereignty must also be ensured throughout the project development process. 

These comments relate to technology because they highlight the importance of considering the environmental impacts of projects involving federal activity and the need to build out the clean energy transition in close consultation with communities most impacted by energy development. This emphasizes the role of technology in developing cleaner and more sustainable infrastructure for communities."
